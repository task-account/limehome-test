 ### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

 ### `yarn test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on tests.

 ### `yarn ios`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open the app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

 ### `yarn android`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open the app on a connected Android device or emulator.
